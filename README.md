# landscanToMetroAreas
For this project, I take 2015 [Landscan](https://landscan.ornl.gov/) data and use it to find metropolitan areas in Peru for Jorge De La Roca.  Metropolitan areas are determined in R while post-processing in performed in Python (thank you GeoPandas and Fiona). I am glad to have been able to find a way to render both arcGIS and qGIS dispensable for computational purposes (of course, they're still great for mapping)
