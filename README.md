# Landscan to metropolitan areas

For this project, I take 2015 [Landscan](https://landscan.ornl.gov/) data and use it to find metropolitan areas in Peru and compute De La Roca and Puga Exposure rates for each metro areas. The project is under the behest of Professor Jorge De La Roca.  Metropolitan areas are determined in R while post-processing in performed in Python (thank you GeoPandas and Fiona). I am glad to have been able to find a way to render both arcGIS and qGIS dispensable for computational purposes (of course, they're still great for mapping). 

There are a few additional layers to the project. I used [GADM](https://gadm.org/) data for Peruvian administrative borders so I can geocode otherwise nameless metropolitan areas. I also used world borders from [Thematic Maps](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php) to clip the world LandScan data down to Peru. The starting points for density and population thresholds for metropolitan areas came from [Definition Matters](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3298761)
